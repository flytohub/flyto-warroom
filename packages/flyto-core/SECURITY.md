## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Flyto2 Core, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

**security@flyto2.com**

Or, if you prefer, you can use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Location** of the affected source code (file path and line numbers if possible)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept** or exploit code (if possible)
- **Impact assessment** - what an attacker could achieve
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with an assessment
- **Resolution Target**: Within 90 days for most issues

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
4. **Fix**: We will develop and test a fix
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate public disclosure with you
6. **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Best Practices

When using Flyto2 Core, please follow these security best practices:

### Environment Variables

**Never hardcode sensitive credentials in workflow files.**

```yaml
# BAD - Don't do this
steps:
  - id: api_call
    module: api.http_post
    params:
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Never hardcode!

# GOOD - Use environment variables
steps:
  - id: api_call
    module: api.http_post
    params:
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${env.API_KEY}"
```

### Recommended Environment Variables

Store sensitive values in environment variables:

```bash
# API Keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# Database Credentials
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"

# Third-party Services
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/..."
export STRIPE_API_KEY="sk_live_..."
```

### File Permissions

Workflow files may contain sensitive logic. Protect them appropriately:

```bash
# Restrict workflow file permissions
chmod 600 sensitive-workflow.yaml

# Restrict .env files
chmod 600 .env
```

### Input Validation

When creating custom modules, always validate and sanitize inputs:

All network modules use `validate_url_with_env_config()` from `src/core/utils.py`.

```python
from core.utils import validate_url_with_env_config, SSRFError

try:
    validate_url_with_env_config(url)
except SSRFError as e:
    return {'ok': False, 'error': str(e), 'error_code': 'SSRF_BLOCKED'}
```

#### Blocked IP Ranges (Default)

| Range | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `10.0.0.0/8` | RFC 1918 private |
| `172.16.0.0/12` | RFC 1918 private |
| `192.168.0.0/16` | RFC 1918 private |
| `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1/128` | Loopback |
| `169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10` | Link-local |
| `0.0.0.0/8` | Reserved |
| `100.64.0.0/10` | Shared address (CGN) |
| `192.0.0.0/24`, `192.0.2.0/24`, `198.51.100.0/24`, `203.0.113.0/24` | Documentation/test |
| `224.0.0.0/4`, `240.0.0.0/4` | Multicast/reserved |

#### Blocked Hostnames

`localhost`, `localhost.localdomain`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `0.0.0.0`, `metadata.google.internal`, `169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata), `metadata.internal`

#### DNS Resolution Check

After hostname resolution, the resolved IP is checked against all blocked ranges. This prevents DNS rebinding attacks where a hostname resolves to a private IP.

#### Protected Modules (11 total)

| Module | Protection |
|--------|-----------|
| `http.request` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `api.http_get` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `browser.goto` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `browser.tab` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `image.download` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `notification.send` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `communication.webhook_trigger` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `llm.chat` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` (custom base URL) |
| `vector.connector` | `validate_url_with_env_config()` |
| `port.check` | `is_private_ip()` direct check |
| `ai.local_ollama` | localhost-only enforcement |

#### Validator Enforcement

The module validator (`validator.py`) requires all network modules to declare SSRF protection via the `ssrf_protected` tag (rule `SEC001` / `CORE-SEC-003`).

#### Configuration

```bash
# Allow private networks (development only)
FLYTO_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true

# Allowlist specific hosts (comma-separated, supports wildcards)
FLYTO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.internal.corp.com

# VS Code local mode (allow localhost only)
FLYTO_VSCODE_LOCAL_MODE=true

# Allow remote Ollama server (default: localhost only)
FLYTO_ALLOW_REMOTE_OLLAMA=true
```

### Browser Automation Security

When using browser modules:

```yaml
# Run in headless mode for server environments
- id: browser
  module: browser.launch
  params:
    headless: true

# Be cautious with file downloads
- id: download
  module: browser.download
  params:
    path: "/safe/download/directory/"  # Use restricted directory
```

### Logging and Secrets

Flyto2 Core automatically redacts sensitive values in logs. However, be careful when:

- Writing custom modules that log parameter values
- Using the `utility.log` module with sensitive data
- Enabling debug mode in production

## Known Security Considerations

### Code Execution

Flyto2 Core executes workflow definitions. Be aware that:

- Workflow files should be treated as code
- Only run workflows from trusted sources
- Review third-party modules before using them

### Network Access

Some modules make network requests. Consider:

- Using firewall rules to restrict outbound connections
- Monitoring network traffic from workflow executions
- Using allowlists for permitted domains (see SSRF configuration above)

### Browser Automation

The browser modules can:

- Execute JavaScript on web pages
- Access cookies and local storage
- Download files

Always run browser automation in isolated environments when processing untrusted content.

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2). We recommend:

1. **Subscribe** to this repository's releases
2. **Update** promptly when security patches are released
3. **Monitor** the [security advisories](../../security/advisories)

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not take legal action against security researchers acting in good faith
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (with your permission)
